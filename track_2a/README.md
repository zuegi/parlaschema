# Academia Challenges

Submissions must use the Apertus model family.
For Track 2 this means that submitted solutions must be built with Apertus. Other open-weights models can be used to support development, e.g. as automatic judges during evaluation. Their role must be clearly described in the submission report.

## How it works
Pick from 5 academia challenges provided by Swiss academic institutions:

- **FHGR:** AI-Powered Job Interview Coach
- **OpenParlData:** Extracting Parliamentary Affairs from PDFs into One Common Structure
- **OST:** Multilingual Natural Language Inference over Swiss Official Voting Booklets
- **UZH:** Detecting Cross-Lingual Semantic Differences in Swiss Government Websites
- **ZHAW:** See It, Say It, Pick It: Vision-Language Grounding for a Real Robot Arm

The challenges incl. submission and judging criteria are described in our **Getting Started guide**:

## Run it

Keep `track_2a/` as it is: don't rename it or move its files, just delete the
other track directories.

From the root of the project:

```bash
make run
```

Fill in the [Makefile](Makefile) so that it works on a clean checkout. It is
expected to run the project in a Docker container, since that is how the judges
will run it, without relying on anything already installed on your machine.

Requirements: Docker with Docker Compose and access to the provided Apertus
endpoint. No model weights are required locally.

Create a local `.env` from `.env.example` and set:

```env
LLM_NAME=...
LLM_BASE_URL=...
LLM_API_KEY=...
```

`make run` currently validates the Apertus configuration in Docker. Local
tests run with:

```bash
uv sync
make test
```

## CI

GitHub Actions runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`, using Python 3.12,
uv 0.8.16 and `uv.lock` (`uv sync --frozen`, `uv run --frozen pytest -q`).
It also builds the Docker image. **Check CLI startup in Docker** runs the explicit
`check-config` command with dummy LLM settings and networking disabled, checking
the entry point, imports and configuration format without calling a model.
CI needs no real API keys and does not deploy or publish images.

## Data
The `data/` directory must not exceed 100 MB.
