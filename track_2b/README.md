# Track 2 B: Own Project

Bring your own idea and build a working Apertus prototype that tackles a problem you care about — any domain, any use case. The project must be new, started within the hackathon period.

Submissions must use the Apertus model family.
For Track 2 this means that submitted solutions must be built with Apertus. Other open-weights models can be used to support development, e.g. as automatic judges during evaluation. Their role must be clearly described in the submission report.

## Target architecture (mandatory)

Whatever you build in Track 2B must be deployable in one of these three architectures:

- **a) On-premise** — on the organisation's own infrastructure, under its own administration.
- **b) Air-gapped** — with no external network connection at runtime.
- **c) Sovereign Swiss cloud** — on a cloud platform operated in Switzerland, under Swiss jurisdiction, with Swiss data residency.

## Data

The `data/` directory must not exceed 100 MB.

## 📦 Submission Requirements & Deliverables

❗️ Submissions are not handled on Devpost but via this URL only:
http://hackapertus.ch/online-hack/submissions

The submission must: 
1. follow the template repo and include all prerequisite files and definitions
2. follow the specified input/output formats
3. run in a Docker container, launched with `make run` from the root of the project
4. run end-to-end when judges try to run it

### Git repo (URL)
- Create your repo from this template (**Use this template**) and work in the `track_2b/` challenge directory. Delete the other track challenge directories.
- Keep `track_2b/` as it is: don't rename it or move its files.
- Set the repo to PUBLIC (Settings --> Collaborators --> Manage Visibility)
- Submit the URL of YOUR Git repo.

### Technical Report (pdf)
- Update [technical_report.md](technical_report.md) in this repository with all the details for your submission.
- Upload a pdf of your technical report to this directory, named as `TeamName_Report.pdf`.
- Format: pdf, max. 6 pages
- Submit the pdf of the technical report.

### Demo video (URL)
- Max. 2 min demo video of your prototype

### Dataset (URL) - optional, depending on your project
Submitted datasets must comply with our guidelines for responsibly sourced datasets.

- Create a user account on Hugging Face
- Clone our dataset template on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HackApertus/online_hack_template
- Complete the dataset card with all required information
- Upload your dataset. It should consist of the following components:
    - evaluation dataset (i.e. individual test cases)
    - model response dataset (i.e. the model response to each test case)
    - metadata file (i.e. additional information about each test case; where relevant, this file must contain instance-level licensing information) 
- Make sure your dataset access control is set to PUBLIC
- Provide the URL of _your_ data set
