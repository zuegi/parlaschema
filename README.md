# Hack Apertus — project template

Template repository for [Hack Apertus](https://hackapertus.ch/) submissions.
Every project keeps almost the same layout, so organizers and judges find the
same things in the same place.

## Select your track

This repository holds one example project per track:

- `track_1a/`
- `track_1b/`
- `track_2a/`
- `track_2b/`

Keep the directory for the track you are competing in **exactly as it is** —
don't rename it or move its files — and delete the other track directories.
That directory is your project root. Keep the files and directories as shown
below.

## The structure

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | The challenge description and submission requirements for your track |
| `technical_report.md` | The deeper write-up: architecture, evaluation, limitations |
| `Makefile` | `make run` must spin up your project |
| `src/` | Your code |
| `data/` | Datasets — `track_1a`, `track_2a` and `track_2b` only; max. 100 MB |
| `findings/` | Issue files — `track_1a` only |
| `docs/` | Diagrams, notes, longer write-ups |

## Run it

Judges run `make run` from the root of the project, on a clean checkout:

```bash
make run
```

`make run` is expected to run the project using Docker, since that
is how the judges will run it.
- If you used other local open-weight models, include instructions for running the project in your technical report.
- Use the following environment variables:
```
LLM_NAME — name and version of the model
LLM_BASE_URL — endpoint base URL
LLM_API_KEY — your API key
```

## Getting started

1. Click **Use this template** to create your own repository.
2. Delete the other track directories. Don't rename or restructure yours.
3. Read its `README.md` and fill in `technical_report.md`.
4. Make `make run` work from the root of the project, on a clean checkout.
